// Write a Javascript snippet to do each of the following. Make your best guess if you don't know. Make sure to put some sort of response on each:

// Add two numbers
x = 2
y = 5
z = x + y
// Multiply two numbers
z = x * y
// Subtract one from a number
z = x - 1
// concatinate two strings together.
s1 = "hello"
s2 = "world"
s3 = s1 + s2
// assign a value to a variable
variable = 1
// increment the value in a variable by 3
variable2 = variable + 3 
// compare two values to see if they are the same
x == y
// check to see if one number is less than another number
3 < 8
// Check to see if two values are NOT equal
x != y
// check to see if a value is less than 10 and greater than 0
10 > x > 0
