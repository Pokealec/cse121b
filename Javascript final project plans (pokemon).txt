Javascript final project plans
Pokemon Index - to help you know more about pokemon.

Using PokeAPI, I will make a website that acts like a pokedex. It will:
- show the name, average weight, and other identifying info of each pokemon
- show some statistics of it's species and the location(s) it is found
- show picture of it, with an option to show the shiny form instead

I will base some of this off of the example code used in the week 5 assignments.Â 
I will import the PokeAPI, and generate an array/list of each species.
I will pull out the name, weight, typing, and some other information from each entry.
It will show at least one image with the option to show shiny form.
I might limit it to just the original 151 pokemon for convenience.
I will show the locations to find said pokemon.

I might add a link to something or pull information from the worldofpokemon site.
